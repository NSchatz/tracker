# tracker

A **self-hosted, Life360-style family location tracker**. An Android phone reports its location to a
server *you* run; family members see each other on a live map and get alerts when someone arrives at or
leaves a place you have defined.

> **Status: early. The server spine only.**
> This repo currently has config, schema migrations, a database pool and `/healthz` — and nothing else.
> There is **no ingestion endpoint, no read API, no map and no Android client yet**; those are the phases
> that follow. It is not usable as a tracker today, and this README will say so until it is. The plan
> lives in the umbrella at `operations/roadmaps/tracker.md`.

## Stack

| | |
|---|---|
| **Server** | Go — `chi` router, `pgx` pool, `goose` migrations; a single static binary |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL + PostGIS**, `geography(Point,4326)` |
| **Client** *(not started)* | native Kotlin (Android) |

**PostGIS is not incidental.** Location math is the product, and it is where a tracker gets things
quietly, confidently wrong. `geography` returns real **metres on the spheroid**; the `geometry` type on
lat/lon returns *degrees*, so the same LA→Paris pair that is `9,124,665 m` comes back as `121.90` — a
number that still looks like an answer. Everything spatial goes through `geography`, and the tests assert
it rather than trusting it.

## Running it

```bash
export TRACKER_DB_PASSWORD='choose-something'   # required — see below
docker compose up -d
curl localhost:8080/healthz                     # {"status":"ok","database":"up"}
```

**There is no default database password, and compose refuses to start without one.** Not a placeholder
you are trusted to change later — a refusal, up front. A default would mean a family's location history,
including minors', sitting behind a Postgres superuser password that nobody ever chose. The same rule as
the server's: never boot with a silent default for a secret.

> Use an **alphanumeric** password, or percent-encode it. It is interpolated into the DSN, so `@`, `/`,
> `:`, `#`, `%` and `?` have meaning there — `p@ss` would be parsed as a *hostname*. You will not get a
> wrong answer if you ignore this (the server fails to connect and says so, loudly), just a confusing one.

> **Changing `TRACKER_DB_PASSWORD` later does not rotate the password.** This is a sharp edge in
> Postgres, not in tracker: the variable is read **only by `initdb`**, on the very first start against an
> empty data volume. Afterwards it is ignored — so editing it leaves tracker's DSN disagreeing with the
> database, and the server crash-loops on *"password authentication failed"*. To actually rotate it,
> change it **inside the database** (`ALTER ROLE tracker WITH PASSWORD '…'`) and set the variable to
> match. `docker compose down -v` resets it too, but that **destroys the location history** with it.

The server **applies its own migrations on start-up, before it listens**, so there is no separate
migration step and it can never serve requests against a half-migrated schema.

`/healthz` pings the database: it answers **503**, not 200, when PostGIS is unreachable. A health check
that reports OK while the database is down just tells your orchestrator to keep sending traffic to a
process that fails every real request.

### Configuration

Environment variables only. There is no config file: the one value the server cannot run without carries
a password, and keeping it on the environment means there is no config artefact to accidentally commit.

| variable | required | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TRACKER_DATABASE_URL` | **yes** | *none, ever* | PostgreSQL DSN (the server reads this) |
| `TRACKER_DB_PASSWORD` | **yes** | *none, ever* | the database password (`docker-compose.yml` reads this) |
| `TRACKER_ADDR` | no | `:8080` | listen address |
| `TRACKER_LOG_LEVEL` | no | `info` | `debug` \| `info` \| `warn` \| `error` |

**The server refuses to start** without a valid `TRACKER_DATABASE_URL` — no default, no empty string, no
guess. A tracker pointed at the wrong database is worse than one that would not boot, because the first
is discovered in production.

## Development

```bash
make check     # THE gate: gofmt · vet · build · test -race · staticcheck · govulncheck
make smoke     # brings the real stack up and asserts /healthz answers 200
```

`make check` is what CI runs and what the umbrella's `scripts/verify.sh tracker` runs — one gate, defined
once, in the `Makefile`.

**`make check` needs a reachable Docker daemon.** The tests start a real PostGIS with
`testcontainers-go`, and **they fail rather than skip if they cannot**. That is deliberate: this
project's correctness *is* spatial SQL, which cannot be tested against a mock — a mock would only ever
assert what we already believed. A gate that skips its bedrock when the database is missing reports green
while proving nothing, so a missing daemon is an error here, not a pass.

## Privacy — the honest boundary

**Location is not end-to-end encrypted, and this project will not claim it is.** The server renders the
map and runs the spatial queries, so it necessarily holds plaintext positions. What self-hosting buys you
is *whose* server that is: the plaintext sits on yours rather than a company's. Anyone with
administrative access to it can read the family's location history. A full threat model ships before the
tracker is usable.
